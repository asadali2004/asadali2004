## Hi, I'm Asad Ali 👋
Final-Year Computer Science Student | Full-Stack & .NET Developer (In Training)

I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student with hands-on experience in 
full-stack web development and a growing interest in AI-powered applications 
and cloud-native systems.

I have worked on end-to-end web projects using the MERN stack, integrated 
third-party and AI APIs, and explored cloud deployment and CI/CD fundamentals. 
Currently, I am undergoing onsite training in the .NET framework and actively 
learning C# with a focus on object-oriented programming, MVC concepts, and 
clean application design.

Alongside development, I have practical exposure to AWS and DevOps workflows, 
including infrastructure automation and CI/CD pipelines using industry tools.

I enjoy building practical, problem-driven applications and documenting my 
learning clearly through clean code, structured repositories, and READMEs.

Current Focus:
- C# and .NET application development
- Object-Oriented Design (OOPs) and MVC architecture
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Understanding CI/CD pipelines and cloud deployment fundamentals

Professional Training & Exposure:
- AWS & DevOps Trainee: Hands-on experience with AWS services, Linux, Git, 
  Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines.
- MERN Stack Training: Built secure, full-stack applications with REST APIs, 
  authentication, and performance optimizations.

Key Projects:
- ChatMate: Conversational AI chatbot with optimized API integration, secure 
  authentication, and performance tuning.
- Rekno: Java-based personal knowledge graph simulating memory decay with 
  REST APIs and structured data persistence.
- AdoptiPaws: Full-stack pet adoption platform focused on usability and 
  engagement.

Tech Exposure:
- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, .NET (learning)
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
- Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Linux, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform (hands-on exposure)
- Tools & Platforms: Git, GitHub, Postman, JIRA
- Languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, SQL

I am continuously learning and improving, with the goal of becoming a reliable 
software engineer who builds simple, scalable, and well-structured systems while 
following good software engineering practices.
